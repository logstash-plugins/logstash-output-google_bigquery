## 4.0.1
 - Documentation cleanup

## 4.0.0

**Breaking**: the update to 4.0.0 requires that you use an IAM JSON credentials file
rather than the deprecated P12 files.
Applications using Application Default Credentials (ADC) _will_ continue to work.

This plugin now uses the BigQuery Streaming API which incurs an expense on upload.

 - The advantages of the streaming API are:
    - It allows real-time incoming data analysis and queries.
    - It allows Logstash instances to be started/stopped without worrying about failed batch jobs.
    - The client library has better support and performance.
 - New configuration options:
    - `batch_size` - The number of messages to upload at once.
    - `json_key_file` - The JSON IAM service account credentials to use with the plugin.
    - `batch_size_bytes` - The maximum number of bytes to upload as part of a batch (approximate).
 - Deprecated configurations:
    - `uploader_interval_secs` - No longer used
    - `deleter_interval_secs` - No longer used
    - `temp_file_prefix` - No longer used
    - `temp_directory` - No longer used
    - `key_password` - Use `json_key_file` or Application Default Credentials (ADC) instead.
    - `service_account` - Use `json_key_file` or Application Default Credentials (ADC) instead.
 - Obsolete configurations:
    - `key_path` - Use `json_key_file` or Application Default Credentials (ADC) instead.
      See [the documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-outputs-google_bigquery.html#plugins-outputs-google_bigquery-key_path)
      for help about moving to JSON key files.
